// This file is intentionally left blank and should NOT export a React component.
// Its presence in this path `(main)/admin/layout.tsx` was causing a "parallel pages"
// conflict with the active admin layout in `/src/app/admin/layout.tsx`.
//
// To resolve the "parallel pages" error, ensure that only one location
// defines the layout for the `/admin` route. The active admin layout is now at `/src/app/admin/layout.tsx`.
//
// If the error persists, you may need to manually delete the `/src/app/(main)/admin/` directory
// or ensure this file does not export a default component.

// export {}; // Previous attempt, ensure no default export.
