// This layout has been moved to /src/app/admin/layout.tsx.
// This file remains to attempt to resolve a potential routing conflict.
//
// !!! IMPORTANT !!!
// If the "parallel pages" error for /admin persists after this change,
// you MUST MANUALLY DELETE the entire /src/app/(main)/admin/ directory
// from your project to resolve the conflict.
//
// This file is intentionally configured to export nothing that Next.js
// would use for routing to avoid conflicts.

export {}; // This ensures the file is treated as a module but exports nothing that Next.js routing would pick up.
