// This file is intentionally left blank to remove the admin page functionality
// from this path and help resolve any "parallel pages" error.
// The active admin route, if any, should be in /src/app/admin/.
// If the "parallel pages" error persists, you may need to manually delete
// the /src/app/(main)/admin/ directory or the /src/app/admin/ directory.
